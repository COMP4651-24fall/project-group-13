# Project
## Titanic Survival Prediction Project
### Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify the traits of passengers who had a higher likelihood of surviving the RMS Titanic disaster. By analyzing factors such as age, gender, socio-economic status, and familial connections, we seek to uncover patterns that influenced survival outcomes.

### Data Visualization
We utilized various data visualization techniques to highlight key insights from the Titanic dataset. Visualizations included bar charts showcasing passenger demographics and socio-economic inequalities, age distribution analysis, and fare distribution box plots, all contributing to a deeper understanding of survival factors.

### PySpark Environment
The project employs the PySpark framework for efficient processing of large datasets. PySpark's distributed computing capabilities enhance performance and scalability, allowing us to conduct machine learning tasks effectively while ensuring fault tolerance through Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs).

### Modeling
We evaluated three different classification models:

- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost): Achieved an accuracy of 78.21% in predicting survival outcomes.
- Random Forest (RF): Demonstrated an accuracy of 81%, with further hyperparameter tuning and ensemble techniques showing limited improvement.
- Ensemble of Na√Øve Bayes, Linear SVC, and MLP: Used a parallel ensemble approach to enhance predictive accuracy, achieving an overall accuracy of approximately 82%.

### Conclusion
While the models demonstrated promising accuracy rates, further improvements can be made through enhanced feature engineering and expanding the training dataset. The project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in analyzing historical data to extract meaningful insights about survival predictors during the Titanic tragedy.
